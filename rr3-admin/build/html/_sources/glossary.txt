   Identity Provider
   IdP
      is a system that creates, maintains, and manages identity information for principals (users, services, or systems) 
      and provides principal authentication to other service providers (applications) within a federation or distributed network.
      It is a trusted third party that can be relied upon by users and servers when users and servers are establishing a dialog 
      that must be authenticated. The IdP sends an attribute assertion containing trusted information about the user to the SP
